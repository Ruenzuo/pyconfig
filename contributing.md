# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
	address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
	professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

# Submitting Issues
Before submitting new issues please check the wiki and search the issues list to see if someone hasn't already opened the same issue. Labels should be used as a way to categorize the type of the issue, check out the list of labels available [here](https://github.com/samdmarshall/pyconfig/labels). If you are filing a bug report or enhancement request on a particular file that you include that file's name in square brackets as part of the issue name to help categorize and group similar work. For example, if there is a problem with `pycparser.py` then the issue's name should start with `[pycparser]`.


## Bug Reports

**Required Materials:**

* Symbolicated Crash Report(s) 
* Example project that reproduces the issue

To properly address the bug I need as much contextual information about how to reproduce it as possible. This means crash report logs and example code that will reproduce the same issue are necessary for me to make progress with your report. 

NOTE: when creating the sample project that reproduces the issue it must be entirely self-contained. Please check-out any submodules or other dependencies and include them with the sample. To be able to take action on any particular problem I expect that when I download the sample I can open it in Xcode and hit "build". Thanks!
